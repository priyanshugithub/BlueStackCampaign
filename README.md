This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a Bluestack Campaign Application. The app displays list of campaigns and distinguish them in three categories
based on date of end. Categories have to be Past, Live and Upcoming.

-- Each tab shows relevant data based on the status of campaign (upcoming, live, past).
-- The very first column shows the time diff from today to that campaign's date.
-- Added a functionality to reschedule a campaign by opening a calendar on clicking the Schedule again icon. (Whatever date you select, it will be shown in the first column named "Date". The time diff shown against it should also be updated).
-- Once the date is changed of campaign. The campaign moves to the relevant Tab (Upcoming,Live,Past) , based on the date selected.
-- Clicking on View Pricing in the row should show a modal with relevant information of the campaign.
